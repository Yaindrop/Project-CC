# Project CC
Project CC is an implementation of [The Connectable Manifesto][tcm] based on two projects:
- Connectable Center
- Connector

Project CC is aimed at providing better user experience for connectable services. 
## Connectable Center
Connectable Center is a front-end container for connectable services powered by [React Native][rn].

## Connector
Connector is a back-end service that combines interfaces of other connectable services, powered by [Vert.x][vertx].
